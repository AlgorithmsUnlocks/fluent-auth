FluentAuth allows you to create different login/Logout redirection rules based on different user criteria such as role and capability
Thus, users will be redirected to different URLs after they log in to your WordPress site based on your redirection rules.

You can set the default redirect rules for after login and after logout so no rule match then it will use your default settings.

You can set as many rules as you want. Based on your provided rules it will redirect based on rule priority.

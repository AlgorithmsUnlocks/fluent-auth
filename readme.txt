**ðŸš€ Two-Factor Authentication for Login**
Enable Two-Factor Login via email for high-level user roles like Administrator / Editor. By using this, only the right person can get access to your admin panel. Even their password gets compromised.

**ðŸš€ Magic Login via Email**
We should also improve the authentication process for end users like customers, and subscribers. Often users forget their passwords, and they have to go through several steps to reset their passwords. In this process, some users just leave your site, and businesses lose money. We have improved the flow and added features where users actually donâ€™t need a password to log in to your site.

They have to just type their username or email address, and this plugin will send an email to the user when log in to the site directly by clicking a secure one-time use time-framed link to log in to your site.

**ðŸš€ Social Login / Register**
Want to enable login via GitHub for your users? Enable this super light-weight feature and let your users log in via their GitHub accounts. (Facebook, Google and other coming soon)

**ðŸš€ Limit Login Attempts**
Block excessive login attempts and protect your site against brute force attacks. Simple, yet powerful tools to improve site security and performance. Configurable lockout timings easily.

**ðŸš€ Dynamic Login Redirects**
WordPress is being used by tons of business types, and sometimes, you need to redirect the users to specific pages after they log in or log out. We have added a super easy configuration opinion where you can easily build your login or logout flow by using our drag-and-drop builder.

**ðŸš€ Detailed Audit Logs**
We also added powerful logs to see exactly when someone is logging into your site and via which media (normal login form, magic URL, or social media).

**ðŸš€ Core Security Enhancement**
XML-RPC is the biggest target for WordPress attacks, and 99% of the sites donâ€™t need that. Disable XML-RPC, Remote Application Login, and Protect wp-users listing for REST API.

**ðŸš€ Security Email Notifications**
As a business owners, we need to add multiple persons with high-level permissions to create content, and manage site; the roles like administrators, editors, Authors, etc. You need to know when these users logging into your site or if someone unauthorized person is trying to log in or not. To solve this, we have implemented email notifications to notify these events.

**ðŸš€ Super Fast Solution**
When we build any plugins, we always make it super-fast and keep it simple yet powerful. This plugin was built using all the latest technologies like WordPress REST-API, VueJS V3, Vue-Router, and Element-Plus for UI building. For storing the audit logs, we use custom Database tables so they will not mess up with your default WordPress Database tables.

== Why FluentAuth? ==

The default WordPress authentication (Log in / Registration) system is kind of basic, and people have to use multiple plugins to enhance the security and improve user experience. One of the most common incidents WordPress site owners get is their site getting hacked. The main reason a site got hacked is hackers send brute-force requests and guess the password, log in to the admin panel, and over-take the site. Another reason is, people use common passwords on different sites, and if one of them gets compromised, then the others will be compromised too.

Many WordPress users add multiple security plugins, which are super-bloated. These plugins intercept every WordPress request run through tons of unnecessary rules, and ultimately it takes more server resources, making the sites super slow.
